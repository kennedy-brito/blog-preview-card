## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project I learned about two main topics: flexbox and viewports.

To center the card I used the flex display, because it's behaviour is more previsible to different screen sizes. And I learned what the viewport unit in css is because I used it to make the body occupie all the screen.

### Continued development

I want to refactor this project css using css variables.
